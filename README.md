# 🦥 You Sloth

# Motivation
I constantly lose motivation whenever I start to do some sport / exercises.
I managed to last 3 months the last time I wanted to get bigger arms (which is a lot already).
But Winter came and I lost motivation again...
Here comes my idea. I need to remind myself to do some exercise each week (at least 3 times a week). Hopefully this app will keep me in the right track.

# What should the app do ?

Everyday, it checks whether I lost enough calories today. If I did lose enough calories, nothing happens.
But if I did not lose enough calories, the app sends me a message and tells me I'm fat and have no will power and most importantly, it calls me a sloth 🦥

# Fitbit

I own a fitbit watch which tracks my activities. The Fitbit API lets me get information about myself.
To use the API, I need to authorize my own app to access my data and save the Access Token.
The access token expires after 8 hours so I need to refresh it thanks to the refresh token every 7 hours or so.
The Access Token and the Refresh Token are going to be saved in DynamoDB.

# Serverless - AWS Node.js Typescript

This project has been generated using the `aws-nodejs-typescript` template from the [Serverless framework](https://www.serverless.com/).

For detailed instructions, please refer to the [documentation](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/).

## Installation/deployment instructions

Depending on your preferred package manager, follow the instructions below to deploy your project.

> **Requirements**: NodeJS `lts/erbium (v.12.19.0)`. If you're using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), run `nvm use` to ensure you're using the same Node version in local and in your lambda's runtime.

### Using NPM

- Run `npm i` to install the project dependencies
- Run `npx sls deploy` to deploy this stack to AWS

### Using Yarn

- Run `yarn` to install the project dependencies
- Run `yarn sls deploy` to deploy this stack to AWS

## Test your service

This template contains a single lambda function triggered by an HTTP request made on the provisioned API Gateway REST API `/hello` route with `POST` method. The request body must be provided as `application/json`. The body structure is tested by API Gateway against `src/functions/hello/schema.ts` JSON-Schema definition: it must contain the `name` property.

- requesting any other path than `/hello` with any other method than `POST` will result in API Gateway returning a `403` HTTP error code
- sending a `POST` request to `/hello` with a payload **not** containing a string property named `name` will result in API Gateway returning a `400` HTTP error code
- sending a `POST` request to `/hello` with a payload containing a string property named `name` will result in API Gateway returning a `200` HTTP status code with a message saluting the provided name and the detailed event processed by the lambda

> :warning: As is, this template, once deployed, opens a **public** endpoint within your AWS account resources. Anybody with the URL can actively execute the API Gateway endpoint and the corresponding lambda. You should protect this endpoint with the authentication method of your choice.

### Locally

In order to test the hello function locally, run the following command:

- `npx sls invoke local -f hello --path src/functions/hello/mock.json` if you're using NPM
- `yarn sls invoke local -f hello --path src/functions/hello/mock.json` if you're using Yarn

Check the [sls invoke local command documentation](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/invoke-local/) for more information.

### Remotely

Copy and replace your `url` - found in Serverless `deploy` command output - and `name` parameter in the following `curl` command in your terminal or in Postman to test your newly deployed application.

```
curl --location --request POST 'https://myApiEndpoint/dev/hello' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "name": "Frederic"
}'
```

## Template features

### Project structure

The project code base is mainly located within the `src` folder. This folder is divided in:

- `functions` - containing code base and configuration for your lambda functions
- `libs` - containing shared code base between your lambdas

```
.
├── src
│   ├── functions            # Lambda configuration and source code folder
│   │   ├── hello
│   │   │   ├── handler.ts   # `Hello` lambda source code
│   │   │   ├── index.ts     # `Hello` lambda Serverless configuration

│   │   │   └── schema.ts    # `Hello` lambda input event JSON-Schema

```

### 3rd party librairies

- [json-schema-to-ts](https://github.com/ThomasAribart/json-schema-to-ts) - uses JSON-Schema definitions used by API Gateway for HTTP request validation to statically generate TypeScript types in your lambda's handler code base
- [middy](https://github.com/middyjs/middy) - middleware engine for Node.Js lambda. This template uses [http-json-body-parser](https://github.com/middyjs/middy/tree/master/packages/http-json-body-parser) to convert API Gateway `event.body` property, originally passed as a stringified JSON, to its corresponding parsed object
- [@serverless/typescript](https://github.com/serverless/typescript) - provides up-to-date TypeScript definitions for your `serverless.ts` service file
